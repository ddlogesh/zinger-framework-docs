A shop owner or any employee who works in a shop must first register his details with the super admin. The user entering the app will be asked to enter the phone number. An OTP will be sent to the phone and OAuth id will be generated. We make a login request to the Zinger Core server to log in the user using the OAuth id and mobile number. If he is a registered user, he will be redirected to the dashboard.

## DashBoard

</div>

The dashboard will be split into 3 tabs - new orders, current orders, order ready for pickup/ delivery. The shop owner can accept or cancel the new orders. After the order is prepared then order status can be changed to out for delivery or ready for pickup. The shop owner must enter the secret key sent to the customer to complete the order.
