Here is an example of **In-Campus Food Ordering application** built using Zinger framework in Kotlin. Similar to Swiggy, we have two apps, one for customer and the other for restaurant owners.

Customers can browse the food menu and seamlessly place order from the various restaurants availing either pickup or delivery service. 

Shop owners can manage and deliver the orders to their customers with the help of seller application. 
They can also edit menu items and its availability with ease.

The source code is made open source and the github link is mentioned below. Please feel free to contribute to the same.
