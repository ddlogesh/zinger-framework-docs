1. **Zinger Core** : <br/>A backend server that exposes the REST API, written in spring boot using MySQL database. 

2. **Zinger Client** : <br/>A customer side application to place and track your orders from multiple store partners near your location. It allows you to browse catalogs of all stores and provides you a seamless shopping experience from order acceptance to last mile delivery.

3. **Zinger Partner** : <br/>is the one-stop solution for store owners to manage their orders from clients and track their business growth as well. Zinger's partner provides store owners with effective order and inventory management.

4. **Zinger Admin** : is a web console to monitor the zinger client and partner apps. It is a powerful tool to track application performance, manage outlet information, and more. Admin console also helps to promote new arrivals and increase brand engagement.
